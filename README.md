# Geographical Experiment with Casual Impact library 

Geographical Experiments are also named as GeoX. To make the idea more concrete, suppose you are leading the digital marketing team for a travel agency chain that has recently become interested in increasing the number of followers on its social nwtworks in a particular city in order to promote sales of travel packages in that location. As the media team leader, answer the following questions:

  - How would you prepare the campaign with the city in question?
  - Once the campaign has been run for the planned time, aew the results reliable?
  - How would you ensure that the increase (or descrease) in adherence to the campaigns during the of the experiment was not due to chance?
  - How would you ensure that the number of followers after the test are caused by effect of the campaigns?

The use of geographical experiments is to seek solutions to such questions, while trying to ensure consistency in the results obtained. To be able to design more general experiments, we will identify the abstract concepts of the problem presented and then think of solutions to it, so that with the solutions developed we can use them in similar circunstances involving other clients and actions.

First step is define the necessary concepts:

  1. Impact: stratefic actin taken;
  2. Objective: what is expect to be observed as the influence of the action;
  3. Metric: quantity used to measure the influence of the action on the objective;
  4. Target: geographical region (city, metropolitan region, country, etc) where the action takes place;

Now, lets re-elaborate the problem presented

## Problematising

We can rewrite the questions asked using the concepts above and generalise them:

  - According to the defined goal, what metric will be used to measure the influence of the achieved impact on the goal?
  - Did the impact happend as planned? Did it change during implementation? Did the collection of metrics remain consistent throughout the period?
  - Are the changes observed in the metrics really a consequence of the impact? Were the any changes outside the team's control that could have affected the results?
